# compchains
Script for calculating basic statistics on a chain

<ul>
    <li><code>compchains_v1.py</code> is a stable script that generates the statistics, histograms (with injection value indicated by a '>' mark), and other features.</li>
    <li><code>compchains_devel.py</code> is an experimental script with new features being added to. </li>
    <li><code>compchains_old.py</code> is the original script. If all else breaks, use this one. </li>

<p>In the resumeproblem directory, all these scripts have been move to 'compchains.' For the sake of compatability, a soft link to compchains_v1.py remains in the directory so you won't have to modify the path to the code in your scripts </p>
